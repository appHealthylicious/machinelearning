Prepare cake according to directions included in the chocolate cake recipe. Note that the cake batter will be very thin, but will bake into a moist tender cake.
Once baked, remove from the oven and cool on a wired rack until cooled completely. You can follow my tips for how to tell when your cake is done.
For the Whipped Mocha Ganache Filling:
Add heavy cream and butter to a small saucepan and heat on low heat until the butter has melted and the cream is warmed throughout.
Add chocolate to a large glass or nonreactive bowl. Pour the warmed cream and butter mixture over the chocolate chips. Add in the brewed coffee and a pinch of salt.

If frosting appears too dry, add more milk, a tablespoon at a time until it reaches the right consistency. If it appears too wet and does not hold its form, add more confectioner’s sugar, a tablespoon at a time until it reaches the right consistency.
For the Chocolate Hearts:
Place a sheet of parchment paper on a rimmed baking sheet pan. Bring about 3 cups of water to a rolling boil in a medium saucepan. Place chopped chocolate into a glass bowl and then place the bowl on top of the saucepan to form a bain marie. Leave for about 3 to 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the chocolate is melted.
Remove from the heat and pour into a zip top bag. Press as much air as possible from the bag and then seal the bag. Snip a small piece from the corner of the bag and pipe the shape of hearts (or other shapes) onto the parchment lined sheet pan.
Once all hearts are formed, place the sheet pan into the freezer for at least about 30 minutes to harden.
Once the cake has been frosted, carefully remove hearts from the parchment paper and place onto the cake.
