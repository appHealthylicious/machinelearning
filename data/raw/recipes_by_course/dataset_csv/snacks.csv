Using a tablespoon scoop or spoon, form meatballs from the ground beef mixture. Heat 12-inch skillet or saute pan over medium heat.

The meatballs should reach an internal temperature of 165º F. Remove the meatballs from the skillet or saute pan and drain on a plate lined with paper towels.
For the sauce:
Reduce the heat on the skillet or saute pan to medium-low heat. Melt butter and whisk in flour until it has turned golden brown.
