The goal of this process is to remove as much of the blood from the venison roast as possible. In my experience, this removes the majority, if not all, of the wild game flavor from the venison. If you prefer that flavor, you can skip this process. Wrap the venison roast well in paper towels and store in the refrigerator on a rimmed baking sheet for up to 3 days. Replace the paper towels with fresh paper towels and a clean baking sheet as the paper towels become soaked in the blood from the venison. On the first day, you may need to replace the paper towels a couple of times during the day. By the third day, there should be very little blood on the paper towels, if any.
Make the Venison Stew
Sear the roast (Brown the roast). Melt the butter in the slow cooker set to brown or in a skillet or Dutch oven set over medium-high heat on the stovetop. Add the olive oil. Using tongs, add the venison roast to the melted butter and olive oil and sear (brown) on all sides.
Make the stew. Add the flour to the drippings in the pan and stir until browned. If in a skillet or Dutch oven, transfer to the slow cooker. Stir in the Worcestershire sauce (or coconut aminos), tomato paste, balsamic vinegar, beef stock, red wine, and Stone House Seasoning. Stir together to make sure it is well combined.
