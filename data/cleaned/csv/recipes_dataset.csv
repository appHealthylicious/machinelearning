468,Dessert,Celebration Chocolate Cake Recipe {and some news!},45,"For the Chocolate Cake:
Prepare cake according to directions included in the chocolate cake recipe. Note that the cake batter will be very thin, but will bake into a moist tender cake.
Once baked, remove from the oven and cool on a wired rack until cooled completely. You can follow my tips for how to tell when your cake is done.
For the Whipped Mocha Ganache Filling:
Add heavy cream and butter to a small saucepan and heat on low heat until the butter has melted and the cream is warmed throughout.
Add chocolate to a large glass or nonreactive bowl. Pour the warmed cream and butter mixture over the chocolate chips. Add in the brewed coffee and a pinch of salt. Allow to stand for about 3-5 minutes to soften the chocolate completely. Stir briskly to combine and until smooth. Press plastic wrap onto the top of the ganache and refrigerate while cakes cool. Once cooled, remove plastic wrap and whip until light and fluffy. Spread between cake layers.
For the Dark Chocolate Buttercream Frosting:
Add dark cocoa powder to a large bowl or bowl of stand mixer. Whisk through to remove any lumps.
Cream together butter and cocoa powder until well-combined. Add sugar and milk to cocoa mixture by adding 1 cup of sugar followed by about a tablespoon of milk. After each addition has been combined, turn mixer onto a high speed for about a minute. Repeat until all sugar and milk have been added.
Add vanilla extract and espresso powder and combine well.
If frosting appears too dry, add more milk, a tablespoon at a time until it reaches the right consistency. If it appears too wet and does not hold its form, add more confectioner’s sugar, a tablespoon at a time until it reaches the right consistency.
For the Chocolate Hearts:
Place a sheet of parchment paper on a rimmed baking sheet pan. Bring about 3 cups of water to a rolling boil in a medium saucepan. Place chopped chocolate into a glass bowl and then place the bowl on top of the saucepan to form a bain marie. Leave for about 3 to 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the chocolate is melted.
Remove from the heat and pour into a zip top bag. Press as much air as possible from the bag and then seal the bag. Snip a small piece from the corner of the bag and pipe the shape of hearts (or other shapes) onto the parchment lined sheet pan.
Once all hearts are formed, place the sheet pan into the freezer for at least about 30 minutes to harden.
Once the cake has been frosted, carefully remove hearts from the parchment paper and place onto the cake. The heat of your hands will soften the chocolate, so work quickly.","{'calories': '493 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '66 g', 'proteinContent': '6 g', 'fatContent': '26 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '16 g', 'transFatContent': '1 g', 'cholesterolContent': '59 mg', 'sodiumContent': '298 mg', 'fiberContent': '4 g', 'sugarContent': '49 g', 'unsaturatedFatContent': '8 g', 'servingSize': '1 serving'}",American,24 servings,"chocolate cake, cream, butter, dark chocolate, coffee, kosher salt, dark cocoa powder, confectioner sugar, milk, vanilla extract, espresso, milk chocolate"

The goal of this process is to remove as much of the blood from the venison roast as possible. In my experience, this removes the majority, if not all, of the wild game flavor from the venison.

Replace the paper towels with fresh paper towels and a clean baking sheet as the paper towels become soaked in the blood from the venison. On the first day, you may need to replace the paper towels a couple of times during the day. By the third day, there should be very little blood on the paper towels, if any.
Make the Venison Stew
Sear the roast (Brown the roast). Melt the butter in the slow cooker set to brown or in a skillet or Dutch oven set over medium-high heat on the stovetop. Add the olive oil. Using tongs, add the venison roast to the melted butter and olive oil and sear (brown) on all sides.
