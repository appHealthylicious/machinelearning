Add the egg and beat until incorporated. Add the flour and mix on low speed, then slowly increase to medium speed until the flour is incorporated and a dough forms. The dough will be soft.\r\nScape the dough out onto a clean, floured surface and shape into a ball. Flatten into a circle and then square off the edges. Roll out the dough into 13x14-inch rectangle with a long side facing you, occasionally adding more flour to the bottom and top of the dough so it doesn't stick.\r\nCinnamon Filling:\r\nCombine the butter, brown sugar, flour, honey, cinnamon, and nutmeg in the mixer bowl (no need to clean it). Beat together until the filling is uniform in color, fluffy, and light, about 2 minutes. Scrape the filling out onto the rolled-out dough and spread to cover the entire surface. You may need to use your fingers for this, as the filling will need to be spread thinly.\r\nTightly roll up the dough starting rom the bottom edge. Wrap with plastic wrap and freeze for 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 350\u00ba F and line baking sheets with parchment paper or Silpats.\r\nRemove the dough from the freezer and unwrap. Carefully slice 1/4-inch thick cookie disks from the rolled log, slicing straight down (do not saw back and forth). Place on the baking sheets, spacing the cookies about 1 1/2 inches apart. Bake until the edges of the cookies start to turn golden brown, 12 to 14 minutes. Let cool on the baking sheets for 5 minutes, then move to a wire rack to cool completely. Repeat with the remaining dough.\r\nGlaze:\r\nCombine the honey, buttermilk, vanilla, and 1/2 cup powdered sugar in a bowl and stir together. If the glaze looks too thin, add more powdered sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, until it has thickened to the right consistency. Brush the glaze onto the cooled cookies with a pastry brush.",

Note that the cake batter will be very thin, but will bake into a moist tender cake.\r\nOnce baked, remove from the oven and cool on a wired rack until cooled completely. You can follow my tips for how to tell when your cake is done.\r\nFor the Whipped Mocha Ganache Filling:\r\nAdd heavy cream and butter to a small saucepan and heat on low heat until the butter has melted and the cream is warmed throughout.\r\nAdd chocolate to a large glass or nonreactive bowl. Pour the warmed cream and butter mixture over the chocolate chips. Add in the brewed coffee and a pinch of salt. Allow to stand for about 3-5 minutes to soften the chocolate completely. Stir briskly to combine and until smooth. Press plastic wrap onto the top of the ganache and refrigerate while cakes cool. Once cooled, remove plastic wrap and whip until light and fluffy. Spread between cake layers.\r\nFor the Dark Chocolate Buttercream Frosting:\r\nAdd dark cocoa powder to a large bowl or bowl of stand mixer. Whisk through to remove any lumps.\r\nCream together butter and cocoa powder until well-combined. Add sugar and milk to cocoa mixture by adding 1 cup of sugar followed by about a tablespoon of milk. After each addition has been combined, turn mixer onto a high speed for about a minute. Repeat until all sugar and milk have been added.\r\nAdd vanilla extract and espresso powder and combine well.\r\nIf frosting appears too dry, add more milk, a tablespoon at a time until it reaches the right consistency. If it appears too wet and does not hold its form, add more confectioner\u2019s sugar, a tablespoon at a time until it reaches the right consistency.\r\nFor the Chocolate Hearts:\r\nPlace a sheet of parchment paper on a rimmed baking sheet pan. Bring about 3 cups of water to a rolling boil in a medium saucepan. Place chopped chocolate into a glass bowl and then place the bowl on top of the saucepan to form a bain marie. Leave for about 3 to 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the chocolate is melted.\r\nRemove from the heat and pour into a zip top bag. Press as much air as possible from the bag and then seal the bag. Snip a small piece from the corner of the bag and pipe the shape of hearts (or other shapes) onto the parchment lined sheet pan.\r\nOnce all hearts are formed, place the sheet pan into the freezer for at least about 30 minutes to harden.\r\nOnce the cake has been frosted, carefully remove hearts from the parchment paper and place onto the cake. The heat of your hands will soften the chocolate, so work quickly.",

Divide cookie dough in half and place half at a time on the parchment paper and roll to desired thickness. Cut cookies with small round cutters, working dough back together and rolling and cutting until all dough has been used and placed onto prepared baking sheets(photographed method).\r\nPreheat oven to 350\u00ba F as cookie dough is in the freezer. Transfer baking sheets straight from the freezer to the oven for baking. Bake cookies 10-12 minutes. Remove from oven and allow to cool completely before adding cream filling.\r\nCream Filling\r\nWhile the cookies are baking, prepare the cream filling.

Add the beef, and any juices, back into the Dutch oven.\r\nAdd vegetables and seasonings. Add in the beef broth or red wine (if didn't deglaze the pan), Worcestershire sauce, Stone House Seasoning, the vegetables, and herbs.\r\nCook the pot roast. Cover and place in the oven until the roast is fork tender and easily pulls apart with two forks. Plan 1 to 1 1/2 hours per pound. Check for an internal temperature of 202\u00ba F when checked with an internal thermometer.

Then, transfer the seared pot roast to the insert of a slow cooker.

Bring the chicken to a boil over low heat until the chicken is very tender, approximately 2 hours.\r\nShred the chicken. Remove the chicken from broth and pull into strips, returning to broth, discarding all but the meat.\r\nCook the soup. Add salt to the broth and increase to a medium heat to bring the broth to a boil.\r\nMake the dumplings. Add the flour and butter to a mixing bowl. Cut the butter into the flour with a pastry blender or forks. Stir in the buttermilk until a soft, shaggy dough forms. Drop the dumplings in to the soup. Stir after every few additions of the dough pieces to make sure they are submerged in the broth and able to cook.\r\nCook the dumplings. Add butter and milk, stirring to combine and often while cooking. Allow to gently boil for 3-5 more minutes, or until the dumplings are completely cooked. Remove a dumpling and cut in half to test for doneness, if needed.\r\nQuick and Easy Chicken and Dumplings Recipe (30 Minutes!):\r\nCook the soup. Add the chicken stock or broth, milk, and salt to a Dutch oven set over medium heat. Bring to a boil and stir in the cooked shredded chicken.\r\nMake the dumplings. Meanwhile, make the dumplings. Once the soup reaches a boil, and you have stirred in the chicken, carefully drop the dumplings into the boiling soup. Stir after every few additions of the dough pieces to make sure they are submerged in the broth and able to cook.Stir the dumplings into the soup, reduce the heat to medium-low heat, cover the Dutch oven with a lid, and cook for about 10 minutes.\r\nCheck the dumplings for doneness. Remove the lid, stir, and remove one dumpling to check for doneness. Cut the dumpling in half to see if it is cooked throughout. If it is, the soup is done and ready to serve. If it is not, return it to the soup and continue to cook.\r\nInstant Pot Chicken and Dumplings Recipe:\r\nCook the chicken. Arrange the rack insert inside the Instant Pot. Place the whole chicken onto the rack and sprinkle with the salt. Add 3 cups of clean water to the Instant Pot. Secure the top to the Instant Pot, close the vent at the top of the Instant Pot lid. Set the time using the Poultry button and reduce the amount of time to 25 minutes.\r\nShred the chicken. Once the Instant Pot reaches pressure, the chicken will cook for 25 minutes. Allow the pressure to naturally release over the next 15 - 20 minutes. Carefully remove the lid of the Instant Pot and lift the rack insert out of the Instant Pot carefully transferring the chicken to a cutting board or platter. Remove the meat from the chicken and return it to the Instant Pot broth.\r\nMake the dumplings. Press the Saute button on the Instant Pot and bring the chicken and broth to a boil. Mix together the dumplings. Drop the dumpling dough pieces into boiling broth. Stir after every few additions of the dough pieces to make sure they are submerged in the broth and able to cook.\r\nCook the soup. Add milk, stirring to combine and often while cooking. Allow to gently boil for 3-5 more minutes, or until the dumplings are completely cooked. Remove a dumpling and cut in half to test for doneness, if needed.",
